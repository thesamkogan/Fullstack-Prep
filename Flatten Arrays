/* 
I started nesting for and if/else expressions twice to first work out whether an index of a array is an integer or an 2nd level array
that was taking a long time to figure out so I googled concat on stack overflow
then I searched concat and flatten and found the apply function.

3 specs, 0 failures
flatten
returns an array
returns a one-dimensional array
flattens a nested (two-dimensional) array and returns a one-dimensional copy
*/


function flatten(array) {
  var arr = [].concat.apply([], array);
  return arr;
}	







//EXAMPLE TEST

console.log(flatten([1,[2,3],4]));
// OUTPUT: [1,2,3,4];
